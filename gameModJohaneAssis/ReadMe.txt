This is the readme for Johane Assis's IT266 Quake 4 mod

After the game loads up,

Step 1: Select "Hey There Bud" option to start a new game

Step 2: Select "Normal Game" option to get into the game you can select any option but 
normal game will do just fine

Step 3: Skip intro story cutscene

If the view is not in third person then set the view by going into the console and typing
seta pm_thirdperson "1"  

Step 4: When you're in the game, to test out the flappy movement deliverable hold the 
spacebar and tap the s key to liftoff from the ground. While in the air, when you hold the spacebar, you'll get 
forced up and you'll go up for as long as you hold the jump button.

Step 5: Use the scroll wheel to see the weapon mod deliverable

Step 6: To see the powerups you could either spawn grunts in through the command line
or just go through the level and kill the enemies through there. If the enemies don't
spawn when you go through the level, then you'll need to kill yourself using the weapons.

Careful when you have the speed mod, when you are jumping you might instantly die if 
hit the ground (if you didn't grab the damage to health power up mod).

speed mod = the powerup that has the lightning symbol
godmode mod = the powerup that has the quake symbol
damage to health mod = the powerup that has the eagle symbol
